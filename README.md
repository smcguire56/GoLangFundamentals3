# How to run :

Firstly you must install the Go compiler  found at https://golang.org/dl/.
Once that is installed I recommend using Visual Studio Code VSC for writing and compiling.

1) Firstly clone this repo using "git clone https://github.com/smcguire56/GoLangFundamentals3"
2) Hold shift and right click to open this folder in CMD.
3) Type "code ." and you’re ready to use VSC with Go Lang.
4) To open the terminal in VSC you can press CTRL + '.
5) You can now save the file and compile in the same window.
6) Firstly to compile each Go file you must type "go build [insert_file_name_here]"
7) After it compiles without any errors, an executable file will appear with that same file name.
8) To run that file just type the full name of that executable file name in your terminal with the .exe at the end.
9) And you’re  done!
